## Description

Ansible is an IT automation tool that allows users to configure, deploy, and orchestrate advanced tasks such as continuous deployments or zero downtime rolling updates. The ProfitBricks module for Ansible leverages the ProfitBricks Cloud API.

## Getting Started

The ProfitBricks module for Ansible has a couple of requirements:

* ProfitBricks account
* Python
* [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
* [ProfitBricks SDK for Python](https://devops.profitbricks.com/libraries/python/)

Before you begin you will need to have signed-up for a ProfitBricks account. The credentials you establish during sign-up will be used to authenticate against the ProfitBricks Cloud API.

Ansible must also be installed before the ProfitBricks module can be used. Please review the official [Ansible Documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html) for more information on installing Ansible.

Lastly, the ProfitBricks module requires the ProfitBricks SDK for Python to be installed. This can easily be accomplished with Python PyPI.

    pip install profitbricks

## Installation

1. The ProfitBricks module for Ansible must first be downloaded from GitHub. This can be accomplished a few different ways such as downloading and extracting the archive using `curl` or cloning the GitHub repository locally.

    Download and extract with `curl`:

        mkdir -p profitbricks-module-ansible && curl -L https://github.com/profitbricks/profitbricks-module-ansible/tarball/master | tar zx -C profitbricks-module-ansible/ --strip-components=1

    Clone the GitHub repository locally:

        git clone https://github.com/profitbricks/profitbricks-module-ansible/

2. Ansible must be made aware of the new module path. This too can be accomplished a few different ways depending on your requirements and environment.

    * Ansible configuration file: `ansible.cfg`
    * Environment variable: `ANSIBLE_LIBRARY`
    * Command line parameter: `ansible-playbook --module-path [path]`

    2a. The preferred method is to update the Ansible configuration with the module path. To include the path globally for all users, edit the `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` file and add `library = /path/to/module/profitbricks` under the **[default]** section. For example:

        [default]
        library = /path/to/profitbricks-module-ansible/profitbricks

    Note that the Ansible configuration file is read from several locations in the following order:

    * `ANSIBLE_CONFIG` environment variable path
    * `ansible.cfg` from the current directory
    * `.ansible.cfg` in the user home directory
    * `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

    2b. The module path can also be set using an environment variable. This variable will be lost once the terminal session is closed:

        export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=/path/to/profitbricks-module-ansible/profitbricks

    2c. The module path can be overridden with an `ansible-playbook` command line parameter:

        ansible-playbook --module-path /path/to/profitbricks-module-ansible/profitbricks playbook.yml

## Usage

### Authentication

Credentials can be supplied within a Playbook with the following parameters:

* **subscription_user**
* **subscription_password**

However, the module can also inherit the credentials from environment variables:

* `PROFITBRICKS_USERNAME`
* `PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD`

Storing credentials in environment variables is useful if you plan to store your PlayBooks using version control.

### Ansible Playbooks

Ansible leverages YAML manifest files called Playbooks. The Playbook will describe the infrastructure to build and is processed from top down. Here is a simple Playbook that will provision two identical servers:

`example.yml`:

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      gather_facts: false
    
      tasks:
        - name: Provision a set of instances
          profitbricks:
              datacenter: Example
              name: server%02d
              auto_increment: true
              count: 2
              cores: 4
              ram: 4096
              image: 25cfc4fd-fe2f-11e6-afc5-525400f64d8d
              image_password: secretpassword
              location: us/las
              assign_public_ip: true
              remove_boot_volume: true
              state: present
          register: profitbricks

### Execute a Playbook

If your credentials are not already defined:

    export PROFITBRICKS_USERNAME=username
    export PROFITBRICKS_PASSWORD=password

The `ansible-playbook` command will execute the above Playbook.

    ansible-playbook example.yml

### Wait for Requests

When a request to create a resource such as a server is submitted to the ProfitBricks Cloud API, that request is accepted immediately while the provisioning occurs on the backend. This means the request can appear finished while provisioning is still occurring.

Sometimes requests must be told to wait until they finish before continuing to provision dependent resources. For example, a server must finish provisioning before a data volume can be created and attached to the server.

The ProfitBricks module includes two resource parameters to address this scenario:

* **wait** (default: true)
* **wait_timeout** (default: 600 seconds)

By default, the module will wait until a resource is finished provisioning before continuing to process further resources defined in the Playbook.

### Wait for Services

There may be occasions where additional waiting is required. For example, a server may be finished provisioning and shown as available, but IP allocation and network access is still pending. The built-in Ansible module **wait_for** can be invoked to monitor SSH connectivity.

    - name: Wait for SSH connectivity
      wait_for:
          port: 22
          host: "{{ item.public_ip }}"
          search_regex: OpenSSH
          delay: 10
      with_items: "{{ profitbricks.machines }}"

### Incrementing Servers

The **profitbricks** module will provision a number of identical and fully operational servers based on the **count** parameter. A **count** parameter of 10 will provision ten servers with system volumes and network connectivity.

The server **name** parameter with a value of `server%02d` will appended the name with the incremental count. For example, server01, server02, server03, and so forth.

The **auto_increment** parameter can be set to `false` to disable this feature and provision a single server.

### SSH Key Authentication

The ProfitBricks module sets server authentication using the **image_password** and **ssh_keys** parameters. Previous examples have demonstrated the administrative user password being set with the **image_password** parameter. The following example demonstrates two public SSH keys being supplied with two different methods.

1. Set the public key as a string in the Playbook.
2. Load the public key into a variable from a local file.

`example.yml`:

    ---
    - hosts: localhost
      connection: local
      gather_facts: false

      vars:
          ssh_public_key: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"

      tasks:
        - name: Provision a server
          profitbricks:
              datacenter: Example
              name: server%02d
              assign_public_ip: true
              image: 25cfc4fd-fe2f-11e6-afc5-525400f64d8d
              ssh_keys:
                  - "{{ ssh_public_key }}"
                  - "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDPCNA2YgJ...user@hostname"
              state: present
